    <h1>Start Learning About Web Developing <hr></h1>
    <h2 class="class-1"> Note: This Page Is Only A Demo And About Some Questions Realted to Web Developing <hr></h2>

    <h2>What is Web Development?</h2>
    <p><mark>Web Development</mark>, well it's the thing that many of the people don't know such as YOU if you're reading this LOL.

    <br>So, How does these Webpages get developed? Well the answer is simple, through a programming Script, yaah! well it doesn't mean that it cann't do it by a <br>programming language.
        Well you see that it is important to know the Programming Script becaouse it is not only suited for beginer <br> these Script are also Dedicated to Designing these Webpages.</p>
        <h2> Why Web Development?</h2>

                but since learning them consumes more time and experience as therefore these These languages become complex and that is why generally HTML CSS nad JS are used.
